routes are like extra backslashes and routes like: \student etc

!
npm i react-router-dom
    -installs  react-router-dom

use minimal required file extension
    -e.g. like in helper.js, no jsx code so js is sufficient

hooks  - basically stateful components for react
-help re-render and change UI based on parameters and ?links

at min 53 why cant rely for latest value, rather gives state? value

everthing renders twice due to stric mode in main.jsx

UseEffect =>
    -only runs once if [] at end is empty!
    -at lest only for when count changes, not count step (2) in UseEffect code

setCount triggers UI re-render!
