the need to have persistent data

need to store and access userdata from previous and at current session
	-e.g. shopping basket in web shop


store on client or server
	-client can only access in same device?

Options:

1. Is in-memory storage on client or server side?
	-guess client only, ai says both
	-so in practice e.g. an array in a running program!
	chrome>ctrl + shift + 1 > application storages

2. File system


3 Databases!

relational - nonrelational

models provide an abstraction to the db
	->Object Relational Mappers ORM
		- allow to oprate on db using high-level prog languages
-> in django
	-basicly can just declare object instances that creat a db entry!
	-so getters and setters
	-deletions

models need to be added to the installed_apps array! see lab 4 notes!
makemigrations command when got new sql commands, whatever new means...

SOP - Same Origin Policy


cookies
	-so defined as client side file system (db) user data?
	-session managments, so for tracking user choices from before
	-managed automatically by browser
	-will automatically? be used in our project
		-for authentication?

3 types but 1 type of cookies
	-session cookies hav no expires, as they are temporary
	-persistent permanent unless expired or deleted
		-APPDATA IS A LOCAL SQLITE3 DB FOR COOKIES!!!
			folder named local is chrome, roaming is firefox
	-third-party


web storage 
	is an alternative for cookies
	easier to process than many cokies


3. ? Client side databaseses
	-cookies not this?
	-rare obsolite websql
	-indexedDB - intended for offline apps - so probably rare as well

4. Local (client) cache
