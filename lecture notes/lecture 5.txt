concurrency - 2 or more things happening at the same time

view is managed by a set of templates in django
	-separating style from content 
		-like w html and css?
	-a template is like a pre filled form...?
		-well the inputs that are "required" are stated


in djangoe requests are objects, that often has a dictionary
	-what is a dictionary?


landing page telss how much stuff in the db
	-this is s template

Storing stat in cookies



Storing state on server side
	-more control to server, safe f
	-a board session table in a db
	-diff to pure cookies is the session-cookie
		-what is it



Client side stroage is scalable but less secure


in project django middle ware? keeps track on the session state?


django hashes passwords to its db
	-submitted passwords ar also hashed and then compared'


User auth

-done by api?

authentication - user is legit
authorisation - has the right to use a proper resource

js runs in the browser


a token for authentication is passed between client n server instead of credentials


refresh tokens used to make a new access tokens



Concurrency

different requests from same? client from different processes can try to access and edit the same resource in the same time

pessimistic vs optimistic
locking 	

-needed in webshop project by 2 buyers having the same item in basket and try to buy it
	-or when editing item name/price
